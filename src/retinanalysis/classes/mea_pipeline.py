class MEAPipeline:
    """
    MEA Pipeline object primarily meant as a container for the MEAStimBlock, MEAResponseBlock, and AnalysisChunk
    objects. The pipeline aggregates these objects and performs methods across them, such as clustery matching
    cell_ids from an AnalysisChunk object (which contains rf params and stas from a noise run) to an MEAResponseBlock
    object (which contains cell_ids and spike times for a particular protocol datafile).

    NOTE: that MEAPipeline objects are not usually created using the initializer. Typically one would use the
    utility function create_mea_pipeline(), which will create each of the input objects and then feed them to the
    MEAPipeline initializer for you.

    Parameters:
        stim_block (MEAStimBlock): A stimulus block object, see help(MEAStimBlock) for more details.

        response_block (MEAResponseBlock): A response block object, see help(MEAResponseBlock) for more details.

        analysis_chunk (AnalysisChunk): An AnalysisChunk object, see help(AnalysisChunk) for more details

        typing_file (str): Optional. Can specify which cell typing file to prioritize when filling in the 'cell_type'
        column of the MEAResponseBlock.df_spike_times DataFrame. By default, we will use the 0th cell typing file
        from the provided AnalysisChunk, or none if none exists.

        pkl_file (str): Optional. Path to a pickle file containing an MEAPipeline object. Use this and leave all other
        inputs blank if you've exported a pipeline object using the export_to_pkl() method.

    Returns:
        MEAPipeline object for the stim_block, response_block and analysis_chunk given to the initializer.

    Properties:
        Use the print command on an instance of MEAPipeline to get a list of all properties contained in
        the object
